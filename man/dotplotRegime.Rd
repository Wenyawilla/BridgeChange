\arguments{
\item{out}{output of HMBB}

\item{hybrid}{If TRUE, DSS results are used for graph. Otherwise, HMBB results are used.}

\item{start}{Starting value of the time sequence}

\item{smooth.beta}{If TRUE, probabilistic estimates of hidden states (smooth) are used. Otherwise, discrete state values are used.}

\item{SE}{If TRUE, draw 95 percent confidence interval.}

\item{x.location}{x location of covariate name labels. If random, a random value (between min and max of x) is selected.
If legend, it will be displayed in the top-right as a legend. If default, the labels will be shown in the above of the last regime estimates.}

\item{distance}{Distance of text labels from the maximum value of x. Default is 4.}

\item{h}{hue value in the HCL color description, has to be in [0, 360]. Default is c(255, 330).}

\item{l}{luminance value in the HCL color description. Default is c(40, 90).}

\item{thin}{The thinning interval used in the simulation.  The number of
MCMC iterations must be divisible by this value.}

\item{verbose}{A switch which determines whether or not the progress of the
sampler is printed to the screen.  If \code{verbose} is greater than 0 the
iteration number, the \eqn{\beta} vector, and the error variance are
printed to the screen every \code{verbose}th iteration.}

\item{degree.normal}{A null model for degree correction. Users can choose "NULL", "eigen" or "Lsym."
"NULL" is no degree correction. "eigen" is a principal eigen-matrix consisting of
the first eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector. "
Lsym" is a modularity matrix. Default is "eigen."}

\item{UL.Normal}{Transformation of sampled U. Users can choose "NULL", "Normal" or "Orthonormal."
"NULL" is no normalization. "Normal" is the standard normalization.
"Orthonormal" is the Gram-Schmidt orthgonalization. Default is "NULL."}

\item{v0}{\eqn{v_0/2} is the shape parameter for the inverse
Gamma prior on variance parameters for V.
If \code{v0 = NULL}, a value is computed from a test run of \code{NetworkStatic}.}

\item{v1}{\eqn{v_1/2} is the scale parameter for the
inverse Gamma prior on variance parameters for V.
If \code{v1 = NULL}, a value is computed from a test run of \code{NetworkStatic}.}
