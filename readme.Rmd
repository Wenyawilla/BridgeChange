## Overview

`R` package `BridgeChange()` constains functions useful to analyze time-series data 
and panel data with possibly large number of covariates and change-points.
This package offers a Bayesian inference on the linear regression mode under high-dimensinal covariates whose effects on the outcome are allowed to be heterogeneous across time.
This package will be useful to discover a set of predictive variables under dynamic setting where time-varying effect is expected to exist in many cases.



## Installation

You can install the most recent version of `BridgeChange` from Gitub using the [`devtools`](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools) package.

```r
# install devtools if necessary
install.packages("devtools")

# install BridgeChange from Github
devtools::install_github("soichiroy/BridgeChange")
```



## Time-series Data

`BridgeChangeReg()` can be used to analyse time-series data with possible change-points.
The functions fits the following linear model:
$$
y_{t} = \mathbf{X}^{\top}\beta_{s_{t}} + \epsilon_{t}
$$
where $s_{t}$ is a indicator of states.
